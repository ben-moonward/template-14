# Next 14 Web template

Contains Generic and unstyled components.

As well as utils and util components for common dev patterns we run into all the time.
 
Intended as both a starting point for Web projects as well as a reference project for examples on how to use common components.

Not focusing on server side rendering for now as future Next usage is up in the air.
