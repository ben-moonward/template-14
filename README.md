# Next 14 Web Template

Contains generic, unstyled components.

As well as utils and util components for common dev patterns we run into all the time.

Intended as both a starting point for Web projects as well as a reference project for examples on how to use common components.

For use with openapi by default.

## Getting Started

1. Add the relevant `.env` file for this project.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run sync-backend` (if using openapi).
4. Run `npm run dev`. Once compiled, you can access the local webpage at <http://localhost:3000>.
5. That's all! :)

## Development

| `npm run dev`          | Start dev server. Reads PORT from `.env`.                                            |
| `npx tsc --noEmit`     | Run a type check over the project                                                    |
| `npm run lint`         | Check for Next errors and warnings (useful to build errors that `tsc` doesn't catch) |
| `npm run sync-backend` | Updates your types to match the latest backend schema (if using fetcher)             |
| `npm run test`         | Run project Jest tests                                                               |
